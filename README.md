# Hello! 

I'm a **Full Stack Software Engineer** who believes great web experiences shouldn't force a choice between beauty and performance. I specialize in **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, building applications that are fast, beautiful, and maintainable.

Before tech, I worked for Hilton in Seattle, and I've found that creating an excellent hospitality experience and an excellent web experience aren't so different—and that is the mindset I bring to my work.

Outside of programming, I like to engage in amateur astronomy and use VSTi (Virtual Studio Technology instruments) to produce sounds in FL Studio.

# Welcome!

My name is Quentin. I'm a self-taught, software engineer that specializes in building frontend web applications.

A strong aspect of my personality is to solve problems. I like to push boundaries of what a website is supposed to be and discover unique ways to find solutions. I enjoy building and experimenting on interfaces, animations, and web features.

My current plans are to enter the industry as a Frontend Engineer / Software Engineer and eventually become a Software Engineer with Frontend and UI/UX specialization.
